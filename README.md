## Shop Taby USA Order Map

This is a heatmap visualization I created for a business I'm a co-owner of: Shop Taby. 

Shop Taby is a womens fashion brand championing size inclusity. Lifetime revenue exceeds $720k. 

### Business Task:

Create a visualization of Shop Taby's USA orders. Include top shipping locations per City and State, as well as Top International Locations.

### Summary

Although Utah is Shop Taby's #1 destination for orders, it represents only 22.45% of our USA Orders.

Shop Taby's top International destination is Canada. With all the confusion around tarrifs, it would be wise to further investigate what improvements could be made to better the sales and delivery for Shop Taby's international clients.
